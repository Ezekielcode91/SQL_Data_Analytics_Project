1. Open pgAdmin
2. In Object Explorer (left-hand pane), navigate to `sql_course` database

4. Get the absolute file path of your csv files
    1. Find path by right-clicking a CSV file in VS Code and selecting “Copy Path”
5. Paste the following into `PSQL Tool`, (with the CORRECT file path)

\copy company_dim FROM '[Insert File Path]/company_dim.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

\copy skills_dim FROM '[Insert File Path]/skills_dim.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

\copy job_postings_fact FROM '[Insert File Path]/job_postings_fact.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');

\copy skills_job_dim FROM '[Insert File Path]/skills_job_dim.csv' WITH (FORMAT csv, HEADER true, DELIMITER ',', ENCODING 'UTF8');
